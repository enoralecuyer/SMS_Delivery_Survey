# SMS_Delivery_Survey


**Project:**
Send an SMS survey once a product has been delivered to a client. Clients can rate the delivery experience: low ratings would trigger a follow-up survey to ask how to improve the delivery experience, high ratings would send a thank you message.

**Tools:**
- [Klaviyo API](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/api-overview)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)


**Flow from Klaviyo with integrated Analytics**
